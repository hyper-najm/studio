Your task is to analyze the provided information (file name, textual content/description, and potentially uploaded file data like an image) to determine if it indicates the presence of malware and educate the user.

Provided Information:
File Name: {{#if fileName}}"{{{fileName}}}"{{else}}Not provided{{/if}}
{{#if textContent}}
Textual Content / Description:
{{{textContent}}}
{{/if}}
{{#if fileDataUri}}
Uploaded File Data (if image/media): {{media url=fileDataUri}}
Instruction for image: If an image is provided, consider it as potential evidence. This could involve looking for steganographically hidden data (if described in textContent), visual cues of a malicious site or document if it's a screenshot, or analyzing if the image itself could be part of a multi-stage attack payload (based on context from textContent or fileName).
{{/if}}

Based on ALL available information, please:
1.  Determine if malware is present (isMalware: true/false).
2.  If malware is detected, identify its type (malwareType).
3.  Provide a confidence score (0-100) for your detection (confidenceScore).
4.  Give a detailed analysis (analysisDetails):
    - Thoroughly explain your reasoning.
    - If malware is suspected, describe its potential impact, how it typically infects systems, and what any identified Indicators of Compromise (IOCs) signify (e.g., suspicious URLs, file hash patterns, registry key patterns).
    - If no malware is detected, explain why the provided information is considered benign or inconclusive.
5.  Suggest comprehensive recommended actions (recommendedActions):
    - If malware is detected, include:
        a. Immediate containment steps (e.g., "Isolate the affected system from the network immediately.").
        b. Eradication procedures (e.g., "Use a reputable antivirus to scan and remove the threat.").
        c. Recovery advice (e.g., "Restore affected files from a clean backup if necessary.").
        d. Preventative measures to avoid future infections of this type (e.g., "Educate users on identifying similar threats.", "Ensure software is updated.").
    - If analysis is inconclusive, suggest further investigation steps (e.g., "Submit the file to a sandbox environment for dynamic analysis.").
    - If no malware is detected, state that no immediate actions are needed but may include general best practices if relevant.

Respond strictly in the following JSON format.
Ensure all fields in the output schema are addressed. If malware is not detected, malwareType can be empty or "N/A", and recommendedActions can be an empty array (unless general advice is pertinent). The confidenceScore should reflect your certainty.
