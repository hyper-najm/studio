  Report:
  {{report}}
  \n
  Provide a concise summary, highlight key findings with their implications, provide the risk score with its significance, and suggest recommended actions based on the report.
  Follow these instructions closely:
  - The summary should be no more than 3 sentences.
  - Key findings should be a bulleted list of the most important points, briefly explaining the impact of each. For example: "- Finding: Outdated software version. Impact: Exposes system to known vulnerabilities."
  - The risk score should be a single number or a short phrase indicating the severity of the risk (e.g., "High - Immediate attention required", "7/10 - Signifies significant exposure").
  - Recommended actions should be a list of actionable steps to mitigate the identified risks.
  \n  Format the output as a JSON object with the following keys: summary, keyFindings, riskScore, recommendedActions.
