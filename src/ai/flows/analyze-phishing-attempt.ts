{{#if content}}
Content to Analyze: {{{content}}}
{{/if}}
{{#if imageDataUri}}
Image to Analyze: {{media url=imageDataUri}}
Instruction for image: If an image is provided (e.g., a screenshot), analyze its visual elements for phishing indicators such as suspicious branding, urgent calls to action, unusual URLs in text, or generic greetings.
{{/if}}

Provide a response in JSON format with:
1.  "riskScore": A numerical score (0-100) indicating the phishing risk.
2.  "threatsIdentified": A list of specific phishing techniques or indicators observed (e.g., "Suspicious URL structure", "Urgent call to action", "Generic greeting", "Request for sensitive information", "Sender impersonation").
3.  "explanation": A detailed explanation covering:
    - The reasoning behind the risk score.
    - An educational breakdown of each identified threat: what it is, why it's a red flag for phishing.
    - Clear guidance for the user:
        - What to do if they encounter such an attempt (e.g., "Do not click any links.", "Do not download attachments.", "Do not provide any personal information.").
        - How to report the attempt (if applicable, e.g., "Report to your IT department or email provider.").
        - How to independently verify the legitimacy of such communications (e.g., "Navigate to the official website directly, do not use links from the suspicious message.").
    - If no significant threats are found, explain why the content is considered safe or low-risk, and perhaps offer a general security reminder.

Example of a good explanation for an identified threat:
"Threat: Urgent Call to Action - The email creates a false sense of urgency by claiming your account will be suspended. Why it's a red flag: Attackers use this tactic to pressure you into acting quickly without thinking. Guidance: Always be wary of messages demanding immediate action. Independently verify such claims by contacting the service provider through official channels."

Respond strictly in the following JSON format:
{
  "riskScore": number,
  "threatsIdentified": string[],
  "explanation": string
}`,
});
