          <CardDescription>
            CyberGuardian Pro's Autonomous Responder is an AI-driven system envisioned to operate independently to manage and neutralize security incidents. It would intelligently analyze threats, execute pre-defined and adaptive response workflows, alert personnel with detailed educational reports, and learn from each event to improve future responses. 
            <br />
            <strong className="text-primary mt-1 block">Please note: The core Autonomous AI Responder system is under intensive development and will be available soon. The information here outlines our vision.</strong>

            We are developing an AI that not only responds to threats but also anticipates them, providing a truly proactive defense layer that educates as it protects. Stay tuned for a smarter, autonomous security future!
